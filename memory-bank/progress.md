## Current Status

The project has been successfully implemented with all core functionality. The API is running and provides endpoints for user management, authentication, and transaction operations including tagging.

The application includes:
- User registration and authentication with JWT tokens
- User profile and balance management
- Transaction creation, retrieval, and deletion
- Transaction filtering by various criteria
- Tagging system for transactions

## Known Issues

None identified at this time. The API should be tested with real-world use cases to identify potential issues.
